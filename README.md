# Driver-Game
Java Game to traverse the shortest path within a given time while picking up the maximum number of coins

 This is a game made in Java using concepts learnt in the OOP and data structures course. The first part requires the diver to traverse the generated maze using some algorithm in order to find the location of a ring. Depending on the number of steps the diver took, there would be a multiplier for the second part and another maze would be generated with gold coins on some of the tiles. The goal is to optimize the Java code in such a way so that the diver is able to collect the maximum number of coins while traversing the maze and reach the exit point of the maze within a certain maximum number of steps. This is my Java code for the same.
